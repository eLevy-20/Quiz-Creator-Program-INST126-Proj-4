# Quiz-Creator-Program-INST126-Proj-4
## Our goal is to write a program that allows quizzes to be taken or created by either regular users or administrators respectively

#### Knowledge is power, as well as everlasting. Quizzes and tests are ways to assess knowledge and understanding on any subject/topic. By creating a program that allows users to take quizzes that cover all subjects, as well as create assessments for others to test themselves, we provide a space where people can see where their knowledge is at. It may also be an entertaining activity for some users who just want to take random quizzes

### 
The program will begin by identifying whether the user is a student or admin, and the user will subsequently be redirected to their respective menu's. For student's, a quiz bank will be displayed and they have the option to click on any quiz and decide whether or not to take it. If they decide not to take it they will be redirected to the quiz bank. If they do take it they will be taken to the quiz presenter which will continue to ask the user questions until they decide they have done enough. As for the admin menu, the admin functions will be displayed and the admin will be able to choose which functions to execute. For example, they can choose to make a quiz, read student results, and more. The code will also have a grader which will score the student on their quiz.
