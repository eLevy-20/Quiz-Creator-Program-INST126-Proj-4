# Quiz-Creator-Program-INST126-Proj-4
## Our goal is to write a program that allows quizzes to be taken or created by either regular users or administrators respectively

#### Knowledge is power, as well as everlasting. Quizzes and tests are ways to assess knowledge and understanding on any subject/topic. By creating a program that allows users to take quizzes that cover all subjects, as well as create assessments for others to test themselves, we provide a space where people can see where their knowledge is at. It may also be an entertaining activity for some users who just want to take random quizzes

### 
The program will begin by identifying whether the user is a student or admin, and the user will subsequently be redirected to their respective menu's. For the student menu, the user will be asked whether they would like to view the Quiz Bank or view their Grades. If they type 'Q' they will be redirected to the Quiz Bank, and if they type 'G' they will be redirected to their grades which will show which quiz was taken as well as the date and time in which it was submitted. If they choose to go to the Quiz Bank they will be asked which quiz they want to take. By typing in the quiz name they will be redirected that specific quiz.

When taking a quiz, the student will be asked the question and told to type in one of the multiple choice options (A, B, C, D). At the end of the quiz the code will ask them to type 'Submit', upon which the date and time will be recorded, as well as their quiz Graded. The score, date, time, and user (name) will be recorded and stored. Student's will be able to see their individual scores (as mentioned before) while Admins will be able to view all submissions across different users. 

The grader function will compare student answers to admin designated correct answers, and if the student answer is not the same as correct answer from quizdefiner() it will subtract a certain percent from 100 each time.

If the user indicated they are an Admin, they will be redirected to the admin menu which will allow them to choose whether they would like to create a quiz or view quiz results by typing in a keyword ('View' or 'Create').
